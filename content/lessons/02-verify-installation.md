# Verify tt-metal Installation

Test your tt-metal installation by running a sample operation on your Tenstorrent device.

## What This Does

This step runs a simple test program that:
- Initializes the Tenstorrent device
- Performs a basic tensor operation
- Verifies the software stack is properly configured

## Run the Verification

This command will run a test operation on your Tenstorrent device:

```bash
python3 -m ttnn.examples.usage.run_op_on_device
```

[âœ“ Verify TT-Metal Installation](command:tenstorrent.verifyInstallation)

## Expected Output

You should see output indicating successful device initialization and operation completion. This confirms that:
- The tt-metal software is correctly installed
- Your device is properly configured
- You can run programs on the Tenstorrent hardware
